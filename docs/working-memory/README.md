# Working Memory - MCP Persistence System

This directory contains working memory documents for the MCP Persistence System implementation. These documents are for Claude's reference during development.

## Project Status

- **Current Phase**: Initial setup and implementation
- **Architecture**: Following HLD.md specifications
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript, Node.js, SQLite, MCP SDK

## Key Design Decisions

1. **SQLite with better-sqlite3**: Synchronous API for simpler code and better performance
2. **MCP SDK**: Using official SDK for protocol compliance
3. **Zod validation**: Runtime type checking for all tool inputs
4. **Transaction-based operations**: Ensuring data consistency

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Git repository initialization
- [x] Node.js/TypeScript configuration
- [x] Testing framework setup

### In Progress
- [ ] Core MCP server implementation
- [ ] Database schema and migrations
- [ ] Tool implementations
- [ ] Search functionality

### Pending
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Claude Desktop integration

## Important Notes

- All tools must be stateless per MCP specification
- Database operations should use transactions for consistency
- Error handling must follow the pattern in HLD.md
- Security considerations: local-first, file permissions
