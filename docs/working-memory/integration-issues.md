# Integration Issues and Fixes

## Current Status
All 7 modules have been implemented individually, but there are TypeScript compilation errors when building the integrated system. This is normal for modular development.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Type Mismatches
- Schema validation type conflicts (optional vs required fields)
- Return type mismatches between tools and base classes
- Missing method implementations in repositories

### 2. Interface Inconsistencies
- Tool interfaces don't match between modules
- Repository method names differ from tool expectations
- Search engine interface mismatches

### 3. Import/Export Issues
- Missing exports in barrel files
- Type definition conflicts
- Circular dependency issues

## Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Type Definitions
1. Align all interfaces between modules
2. Fix schema validation conflicts
3. Ensure consistent method signatures

### Phase 2: Fix Repository Issues
1. Add missing methods to repositories
2. Align method names with tool expectations
3. Fix return type mismatches

### Phase 3: Fix Tool Integration
1. Update tools to use correct repository interfaces
2. Fix validation schemas
3. Ensure consistent error handling

### Phase 4: Fix Server Integration
1. Update server to use corrected tools
2. Fix configuration issues
3. Ensure proper initialization order

## Priority Order
1. Types and interfaces (foundation)
2. Repositories (data layer)
3. Tools (business logic)
4. Server (integration layer)
