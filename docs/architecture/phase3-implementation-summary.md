# Phase 3: Cross-Conversation Intelligence - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of Phase 3: Cross-Conversation Intelligence, which adds a knowledge graph layer to the MCP Persistence System using SQLite-native features. The implementation enables entity recognition, relationship detection, and graph-based queries across all conversations.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. SQLite-Native Approach
- **Decision**: Use SQLite with recursive CTEs and JSON1 extension instead of dedicated graph databases
- **Rationale**: Aligns with "Graph DB overkill for desktop" principle from ROADMAP.md
- **Benefits**: 
  - No external dependencies
  - Leverages existing SQLite infrastructure
  - Maintains single-file portability
  - Reduces system complexity

### 2. Pattern-Based Entity Extraction
- **Decision**: Start with regex patterns enhanced from EntityCentricStrategy
- **Rationale**: Pragmatic approach that can be enhanced with NLP later
- **Benefits**:
  - Fast processing
  - No ML model dependencies
  - Privacy-preserving (all local)
  - Easy to customize and extend

### 3. Co-occurrence Relationship Detection
- **Decision**: Detect relationships based on entity co-occurrence patterns and contextual cues
- **Rationale**: Balances accuracy with performance for desktop use
- **Benefits**:
  - Works without training data
  - Captures implicit relationships
  - Configurable confidence thresholds

## Database Schema

### New Tables Added (Migration 004)

#### `entities`
Central registry of all extracted entities with metadata and confidence scores.

#### `entity_mentions` 
Links entities to specific messages with position and context information.

#### `entity_relationships`
Tracks relationships between entities with strength scores and temporal data.

#### `conversation_topics`
High-level topic extraction per conversation for better organization.

#### `entity_evolution`
Tracks how understanding of entities changes over time.

### Performance Optimizations

#### Indexes
- **Entity lookups**: `idx_entities_name`, `idx_entities_type`
- **Mention queries**: `idx_mentions_entity`, `idx_mentions_conversation`
- **Relationship traversal**: `idx_relationships_source`, `idx_relationships_target`
- **Graph queries**: `idx_relationships_bidirectional`

#### Views
- **`entity_summary`**: Aggregated entity statistics
- **`conversation_entity_networks`**: Entity networks per conversation

#### FTS5 Integration
- **`entities_fts`**: Full-text search for entity names and descriptions
- **Hybrid search**: Combines entity search with existing message search

## Core Components

### 1. EntityExtractor (`src/knowledge-graph/EntityExtractor.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Extract entities from message content using pattern matching
- **Features**:
  - 8 entity types (person, organization, product, concept, location, technical, event, decision)
  - Confidence scoring based on pattern quality and context
  - Configurable extraction parameters
  - Context capture around entity mentions

### 2. RelationshipDetector (`src/knowledge-graph/RelationshipDetector.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Detect relationships between entities in text
- **Features**:
  - 8 relationship types (works_for, created_by, discussed_with, etc.)
  - Pattern-based and co-occurrence detection
  - Confidence scoring with contextual adjustments
  - Temporal relationship tracking

### 3. KnowledgeGraphRepository (`src/storage/repositories/KnowledgeGraphRepository.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Database operations for knowledge graph data
- **Features**:
  - CRUD operations for entities, mentions, and relationships
  - Graph traversal queries using recursive CTEs
  - Entity clustering and path finding
  - Performance-optimized prepared statements

### 4. KnowledgeGraphService (`src/knowledge-graph/KnowledgeGraphService.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Main orchestration service for knowledge graph operations
- **Features**:
  - Message processing pipeline
  - Cross-conversation analysis
  - Entity history tracking
  - Batch processing capabilities

## Graph Query Patterns

### 1. Connected Entities (N-Degree Traversal)
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE entity_graph(...) AS (
  -- Base case: direct relationships
  SELECT source_entity_id, target_entity_id, path, 1 as degree, strength
  FROM entity_relationships 
  WHERE source_entity_id = ? AND strength >= ?
  
  UNION ALL
  
  -- Recursive case: extend path
  SELECT eg.entity_id, r.target_entity_id, 
         json_insert(eg.path, '$[#]', r.target_entity_id),
         eg.degree + 1, r.strength * eg.strength
  FROM entity_graph eg
  JOIN entity_relationships r ON eg.target_id = r.source_entity_id
  WHERE eg.degree < ? AND [cycle_detection]
)
```

### 2. Shortest Path Between Entities
Uses bidirectional search with strength-weighted paths for optimal relationship discovery.

### 3. Entity Clustering
Identifies entity communities based on co-occurrence patterns and relationship strength.

### 4. Temporal Analysis
Tracks relationship strength changes over time with configurable decay parameters.
