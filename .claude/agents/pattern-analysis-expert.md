## Pattern Detection Strategies

### Temporal Pattern Analysis
```sql
-- Example: Detect conversation timing patterns
WITH conversation_intervals AS (
  SELECT 
    conversation_id,
    created_at,
    LAG(created_at) OVER (ORDER BY created_at) as prev_created,
    JULIANDAY(created_at) - JULIANDAY(LAG(created_at) OVER (ORDER BY created_at)) as gap_days
  FROM conversations
  WHERE created_at >= datetime('now', '-30 days')
),
pattern_analysis AS (
  SELECT
    CASE 
      WHEN gap_days < 1 THEN 'rapid'
      WHEN gap_days BETWEEN 1 AND 7 THEN 'regular'
      WHEN gap_days > 7 THEN 'sparse'
    END as pattern_type,
    COUNT(*) as frequency,
    AVG(gap_days) as avg_gap,
    STDDEV(gap_days) as gap_variance
  FROM conversation_intervals
  WHERE gap_days IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY pattern_type
)
SELECT * FROM pattern_analysis;
```

### Message Pattern Detection
```sql
-- Detect user behavior patterns
WITH user_patterns AS (
  SELECT 
    role,
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as message_count,
    AVG(LENGTH(content)) as avg_length,
    COUNT(DISTINCT conversation_id) as conversations
  FROM messages
  WHERE created_at >= datetime('now', '-7 days')
  GROUP BY role, DATE(created_at)
),
pattern_scores AS (
  SELECT 
    role,
    AVG(message_count) as avg_daily_messages,
    STDDEV(message_count) as message_variance,
    AVG(avg_length) as typical_message_length,
    COUNT(DISTINCT date) as active_days
  FROM user_patterns
  GROUP BY role
)
SELECT 
  role,
  avg_daily_messages,
  CASE 
    WHEN message_variance < avg_daily_messages * 0.3 THEN 'consistent'
    WHEN message_variance < avg_daily_messages * 0.7 THEN 'moderate'
    ELSE 'variable'
  END as consistency_pattern,
  typical_message_length,
  active_days
FROM pattern_scores;
```

## Statistical Analysis Methods

### Pattern Confidence Scoring
```sql
-- Calculate pattern confidence based on frequency and consistency
CREATE VIEW pattern_confidence AS
WITH pattern_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    pattern_type,
    COUNT(*) as frequency,
    COUNT(*) * 1.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pattern_detections) as relative_frequency,
    STDDEV(confidence_score) as score_variance,
    AVG(confidence_score) as avg_confidence
  FROM pattern_detections
  GROUP BY pattern_type
)
SELECT 
  pattern_type,
  frequency,
  relative_frequency,
  CASE 
    WHEN frequency >= 10 AND score_variance < 0.2 THEN 'high'
    WHEN frequency >= 5 AND score_variance < 0.4 THEN 'medium'
    ELSE 'low'
  END as confidence_level,
  avg_confidence * relative_frequency as weighted_confidence
FROM pattern_stats;
```

### Trend Analysis
```typescript
// Statistical trend detection
interface TrendAnalysis {
  slope: number;
  correlation: number;
  significance: number;
  trend: 'increasing' | 'decreasing' | 'stable';
}

function detectTrend(dataPoints: Array<{ x: number; y: number }>): TrendAnalysis {
  const n = dataPoints.length;
  const sumX = dataPoints.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.x, 0);
  const sumY = dataPoints.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.y, 0);
  const sumXY = dataPoints.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.x * p.y, 0);
  const sumX2 = dataPoints.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.x * p.x, 0);
  const sumY2 = dataPoints.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.y * p.y, 0);

  const slope = (n * sumXY - sumX * sumY) / (n * sumX2 - sumX * sumX);
  const correlation = (n * sumXY - sumX * sumY) / 
    Math.sqrt((n * sumX2 - sumX * sumX) * (n * sumY2 - sumY * sumY));

  return {
    slope,
    correlation,
    significance: Math.abs(correlation),
    trend: slope > 0.1 ? 'increasing' : slope < -0.1 ? 'decreasing' : 'stable'
  };
}
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Efficient Pattern Queries
```sql
-- Use indexes for pattern matching
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_temporal ON messages(created_at, conversation_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_content ON messages_fts(content);
CREATE INDEX idx_pattern_detections_type ON pattern_detections(pattern_type, created_at);

-- Materialized view for frequent pattern analysis
CREATE TABLE pattern_summary AS
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as analysis_date,
  pattern_type,
  COUNT(*) as occurrences,
  AVG(confidence_score) as avg_confidence,
  MAX(confidence_score) as max_confidence
FROM pattern_detections
GROUP BY DATE(created_at), pattern_type;
```

### Query Optimization Strategies
1. **Use appropriate indexes** for temporal and pattern-based queries
2. **Limit result sets** with LIMIT and proper WHERE clauses
3. **Use CTEs** for complex multi-step analysis
4. **Cache frequently accessed patterns** in materialized views
5. **Batch process large datasets** to avoid memory issues

## Pattern Recognition Algorithms

### Sequence Pattern Detection
```typescript
interface SequencePattern {
  sequence: string[];
  frequency: number;
  confidence: number;
  avgGapTime: number;
}

function detectSequencePatterns(
  messages: Array<{ content: string; timestamp: number; role: string }>,
  minLength: number = 2,
  maxGap: number = 3600000 // 1 hour in ms
): SequencePattern[] {
  const sequences = new Map<string, SequencePattern>();
  
  for (let i = 0; i < messages.length - minLength + 1; i++) {
    for (let len = minLength; len <= Math.min(5, messages.length - i); len++) {
      const sequence = messages.slice(i, i + len);
      const maxGapTime = Math.max(...sequence.slice(1).map((msg, idx) => 
        msg.timestamp - sequence[idx].timestamp
      ));
      
      if (maxGapTime <= maxGap) {
        const pattern = sequence.map(m => `${m.role}:${m.content.slice(0, 50)}`);
        const key = pattern.join('->');
        
        if (!sequences.has(key)) {
          sequences.set(key, {
            sequence: pattern,
            frequency: 0,
            confidence: 0,
            avgGapTime: 0
          });
        }
        
        const existing = sequences.get(key)!;
        existing.frequency++;
        existing.avgGapTime = (existing.avgGapTime + maxGapTime) / 2;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Calculate confidence based on frequency and consistency
  return Array.from(sequences.values()).map(pattern => ({
    ...pattern,
    confidence: Math.min(0.95, pattern.frequency / messages.length + 
                         (1 - pattern.avgGapTime / maxGap) * 0.3)
  }));
}
```
