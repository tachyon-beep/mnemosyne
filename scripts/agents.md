# MCP Persistence System - Development Agents

## Overview

This document defines specialized agents for the MCP Persistence System development. These agents are designed to handle specific aspects of the implementation efficiently.

## Agent: mcp-implementation

**Purpose**: Implement core MCP server functionality and protocol compliance

**Capabilities**:
- Set up MCP server with stdio transport
- Implement JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling
- Create tool registration system
- Handle protocol initialization and capability negotiation

**Key Tasks**:
1. Create base MCP server class
2. Implement tool registration mechanism
3. Set up proper error handling for protocol messages
4. Ensure stateless tool execution

## Agent: database-architect

**Purpose**: Design and implement SQLite database schema and operations

**Capabilities**:
- Create database schema from HLD specifications
- Implement migration system
- Set up database connection pooling
- Optimize queries and indexes

**Key Tasks**:
1. Create initial database schema
2. Implement migration runner
3. Set up WAL mode and performance optimizations
4. Create database utility functions

## Agent: tool-implementer

**Purpose**: Implement individual MCP tools according to specifications

**Capabilities**:
- Implement save_message tool with transaction support
- Create search functionality with FTS5
- Build conversation retrieval tools
- Add proper Zod validation for all inputs

**Key Tasks**:
1. Implement each tool as defined in HLD.md
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Ensure all operations are atomic
4. Create tool response formatting

## Agent: search-optimizer

**Purpose**: Implement and optimize search functionality

**Capabilities**:
- Set up SQLite FTS5 for full-text search
- Implement query sanitization and building
- Add search result ranking
- Create snippet generation for results

**Key Tasks**:
1. Configure FTS5 virtual table
2. Implement search query parser
3. Add relevance ranking
4. Optimize search performance

## Agent: test-engineer

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive test suite

**Capabilities**:
- Write unit tests for all components
- Create integration tests for MCP protocol
- Set up test database fixtures
- Implement performance benchmarks

**Key Tasks**:
1. Set up test infrastructure
2. Create unit tests for each module
3. Write integration tests for tool interactions
4. Add stress tests for database operations

## Usage

When working on specific parts of the system, invoke the appropriate agent:

```
For MCP protocol work: Use mcp-implementation agent
For database schema: Use database-architect agent  
For tool development: Use tool-implementer agent
For search features: Use search-optimizer agent
For testing: Use test-engineer agent
```

Each agent has deep knowledge of their domain and can work independently while maintaining consistency with the overall architecture.
